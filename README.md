## ðŸ’¡ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Inspiration**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ’¡
AI Vault was created to address the challenge of securely sharing and selling AI models, particularly for buyers. As AI adoption grows, we noticed a gap in platforms that allow organizations to showcase their models while ensuring data privacy and intellectual property protection. Our goal was to build a marketplace where companies can securely present their AI solutions, making it easier for businesses to find, purchase, and integrate the models they need securely and straightforwardly.

## ðŸ¤” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**What is AI Vault?**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ¤”
AI Vault is a secure marketplace for AI models, enabling developers to upload, manage, and sell their work without exposing the underlying data. The platform is designed to make accessing and utilizing AI models straightforward and efficient, offering a streamlined solution for anyone looking to leverage AI in their projects. The focus is on creating a safe and practical environment for exchanging of AI-driven solutions.


## ðŸ”„ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Shifting *perspective* of AI**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ”„
AI Vault offers a secure platform for companies and creators to share and sell AI models. While large open-source AI models are readily available, the rise of custom AI from individuals and small groups presents new risks. Misuse of AI, from scams to more harmful activities, becomes a concern as the technology becomes more accessible. AI Vault helps address these risks by ensuring models are shared responsibly and protected.
